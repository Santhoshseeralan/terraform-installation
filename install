Sure, here are the steps to install Terraform on Ubuntu:

1. **Update Package Index:**
   
   First, ensure your package index is up-to-date:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   Install the necessary packages which will be required to download and install Terraform:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y curl unzip
   ```

3. **Download Terraform:**

   Use `curl` to download the Terraform binary. You can check the latest version from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html):
   ```bash
   export TF_VERSION="0.15.5"  # Replace with the latest version
   curl -LO https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/${TF_VERSION}/terraform_${TF_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip

   unzip terraform_${TF_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip
   ```

5. **Move Terraform Binary:**

   Move the extracted binary to a directory included in your system's PATH to make it executable system-wide. `/usr/local/bin` is a common choice:
   ```bash
   sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
   ```

6. **Verify Installation:**

   Verify that Terraform is installed correctly by checking its version:
   ```bash
   terraform version
   ```

   You should see the installed Terraform version printed to the console.

Now you have successfully installed Terraform on your Ubuntu system. You can start using it to manage your infrastructure as code.
